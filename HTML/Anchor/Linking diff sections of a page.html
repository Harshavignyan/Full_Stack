An anthology of new works that reflect events, opinions and sentiments from a fleeting and fatalistic moment in time — one that was both sensational and sorrowful in equal measure. This period of the author’s life is now over, the chapter closed and boarded up. There is nothing to avenge, no scores to settle once wounds have healed. And upon further reflection, a good number of them turned out to be self-inflicted. This writer is of the firm belief that our tears become holy in the form of ink on a page. Once we have spoken our saddest story, we can be free of it. And then all that’s left behind is the tortured poetry (sic),” Taylor said in her long post shared on her Instagram handle. And while her post reads that she has moved on from her lovers, who broke her heart and the trauma that she faced in her initial days, the songs talk about episodes from her life and depict that she is still clinging on to the hurt and betrayal.</p>

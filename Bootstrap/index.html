            Bootstrap is an HTML, CSS and JS library that focuses on simplifying the development of informative web pages
            (as opposed to web applications). The primary purpose of adding it to a web project is to apply Bootstrap's
            choices of color, size, font and layout to that project. As such, the primary factor is whether the developers
            in charge find those choices to their liking. Once added to a project, Bootstrap provides basic style
            definitions for all HTML elements. The result is a uniform appearance for prose, tables and form elements across
            web browsers. In addition, developers can take advantage of CSS classes defined in Bootstrap to further
            customize the appearance of their contents. For example, Bootstrap has provisioned for light- and dark-colored
            tables, page headings, more prominent pull quotes, and text with a highlight.
    
            Bootstrap also comes with several JavaScript components which do not require other libraries like jQuery. They
            provide additional user interface elements such as dialog boxes, tooltips, progress bars, navigation drop-downs,
            and carousels. Each Bootstrap component consists of an HTML structure, CSS declarations, and in some cases
            accompanying JavaScript code. They also extend the functionality of some existing interface elements, including
            for example an auto-complete function for input fields.

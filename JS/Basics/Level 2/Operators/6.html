            If the total selling price of 15 items
            and the total profit earned on them is
            input through the keyboard, write a program
            to find the cost price of one item.

        <script>
            var sp = +prompt("enter the selling price: ");
            var tp = +prompt("enter the total profit: ");

            var cp = sp - tp;

            // profit = selling price - cost price

            document.write("so the cost price = " + cp);
